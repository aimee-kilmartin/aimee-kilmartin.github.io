        <h3 class="heading3">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
          <p><ul>
            <li>I am very self critical</li>
            <li>My determination will take me far</li>
            <li>It is okay to be vulnerable and grow from it</li>
            </ul></p>
        <h3 class="heading3">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
          <p>Values are important in learning, programming, and every aspect of life. They are what keeps us accountable for being the person we are - the stronger your values, the stronger you push to uphold those</p>
          <p>Empathy is so important and this can apply to empathy for others who are on the learning journey as well, or empathy for yourself. To show yourself kindness is a strength, and for me I need a constant reminder to do this. I’m sure it will get easier with practice!</p>
          <p>Self-awareness is another huge skill - this plays a role in identifying your own strengths and weaknesses - if you can identify those you can then adapt and utilise those strengths, and work on the weaknesses.. For example I have found that I can work really well in the evening - so I do some study between 9 and midnight and it’s some of my more focused work. I didn’t get the opportunity for that working at a 9-5!</p>
          <h3 class="heading3">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
          <p>How vulnerable and openly I can write, knowing I’m going to put it on the internet and near strangers will read it. I’ve given it my all in putting all of my thoughts/feelings/self into what I write. I want to be true to myself, and i’m figuring that out as I go</p>
          <h3 class="heading3">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
          <p>Feeling all the feelings - some of it was really difficult emotionally. One part that stood out to me as the hardest was the identity and values blog. I had to really analyse who I am, what makes me who I am, as well as who do I want to be? That will still be a process for now, but that was a really big step</p>
          <h3 class="heading3">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
          <p>I see it as an investment in the whole person of a student at Dev Academy. A programmer is not just a programmer, but also a thinker, a learner, a teacher, a leader. A human being. Students moving on to a programming career will most likely be working in a team - and a team needs well rounded individuals to operate at its best. This increases employability, as well as maintaining a reputation for training people as such.
            Another benefit of learning core is actually preparing for Bootcamp - getting in touch with oneself will only benefit the student in the next stage as well as improve the whole experience for the individual
