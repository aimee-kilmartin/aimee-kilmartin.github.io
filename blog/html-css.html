    <div class="container2">
      <div class="center">
        <h3 class="heading3">Static</h3>
        <div class="main-text">
          <p>
            This is the default type of positioning that all HTML elements
            receive, until otherwise specified with one of the positioning
            attributes detailed below.
          </p>
          <p>
            The static position puts the element in the document page based on
            where the element is sitting amongst the HTML code - this runs in
            order from top to bottom just like reading these paragraphs here.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="heading3">Relative</h3>
        <div class="main-text">
          <p>
            Relative positioning is similar to static positioning - the element
            will be positioned relatively to its original location when it was a
            static element. The element still retains its place in the order of
            the document, however you can force the element in a direction or
            directions from its default position.
          </p>
          <p>
            This can be controlled by the properties of: top, right, bottom, and
            left which will move the element X amount from the direction
            specified.
          </p>
          <p>
            So left:20px will move the element 20 pixels from the left (so will
            appear as moved to the right).
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="heading3">Absolute</h3>
        <div class="main-text">
          <p>
            The Absolute positioning removes the element from the normal layout
            of surrounding (static or relative) elements. 
            The absolute element then behaves as if it is on its own layer, appearing closer to the
            viewer than the other elements. It's position is based a relative value in comparison to another element.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the properties of: top, right, bottom, and left will move the
            element X distance from the edge of the containing (parent) element.
          </p>
          <p>
            So if an absolute element has properties of top:20px; and right:50px; it will show
            on the page 20 pixels down from the top and 50 pixels away from the right of the element
            it is contained in.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="heading3">Fixed</h3>
        <div class="main-text">
          <p>
            Fixed positioning works in a similar way to absolute positioning as
            it is removed from the normal layout into its own layer. However the
            key difference between them is that absolute positioning places an
            element X away from its containing element, whereas fixed
            positioning places the element X away from the edge of the browser
            window or viewport.
          </p>
          <p>
            This means that the fixed element can have the property top:50px in
            which the element will stay 50 pixels down from the top of the
            visible area of the page. It stays in the same place regardless of
            how far down the page the user has scrolled.

          <h2 class="heading2">Terminology</h2>
          <div class="container4">
            <div class="center">
              <h3 class="heading3">Element</h3>
              <div>
                <p>Item, section of code</p>
              </div>
              <h3 class="heading3">Viewport</h3>
              <div>
                <p>The viewport is, in simple terms, the visible screen.</p>
                <p>
                  With many different types of devices commonly used, webpages
                  need to adapt to the different sizes and ratios so viewers can
                  use the same website on their phone, tablet or laptop with
                  ease.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3 class="heading3">Units</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                  The are many different units that can be used - I have used
                  pixels in the examples here but there are many other types
                  available in CSS
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fixed units are the same size regardless of the viewport, and
                  relative units are scalable dependant on the viewport
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3 class="heading3">Containing Elements</h3>
              <p>
                The containing element of the absolute element being modified is
                the nearest parent element with the positioning type:relative.
                If there is no parent relative element, the containing element
                will default to the first parent static element of the block of
                code
              </p>
