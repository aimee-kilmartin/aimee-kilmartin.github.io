        <h3 class="heading3">Neuroplasticity Principles and Benefits</h3>
        <p>
          Understanding neuroplasticity benefits people by removing the ‘can’t’
          from people’s thinking. This links in with the growth mindset below as
          well, because with both of these together the limitations put on us
          are removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are each born with a certain amount of neurons in our brain - they
          can become damaged and we cannot repair or regenerate our neurons.
          However, what we can generate is our neural pathways - this is what
          connects the neurons and these pathways are activated from using our
          memory and actions. Neuroplasticity is the malleability of the brain
          via repetition of an action, phrase or thought that strengthens this
          neural pathway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding that this is within our control benefits everyone
          whenever they want to learn something new - from a new language or
          paper at university, through to how to boil an egg or pronounce a
          name. It doesn’t matter how big or small the thing is! These things
          become easier over time as we strengthen the relevant pathways in our
          brain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of the principles found in my research (commonly 10 principles were
          referred to) I found these the most relevant to my learning:
        </p>
        <ul class="left-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Use it and improve it:</strong> Neural pathways grow
            stronger the more they are used
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Specificity:</strong> Your brain forms a specific circuitry
            in response to specific activities
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Time matters:</strong> It takes varying amounts of time for
            the brain to change depending on how complex or foreign the new
            behavior or skill is to you
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When we learn, we create and strengthen these pathways, allowing us to
          use our knowledge at a later stage. Our pathways can be strengthened
          both by ‘doing’ the thing we are wanting to learn, and by thinking
          about doing it - ‘mental practice’.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will apply this to my learning with Dev Academy by practicing, both
          physically and mentally. Thinking about what I am doing, why and how
          both during an exercise and after. Knowing that putting things into
          practice will strengthen my learning, will help motivate me to be in
          control of this experience, that it is in my hands. I will make the
          most of the time I have, use repetition and specificity to strengthen
          my learning.

          What are some of the ways to increase neuroplasticity?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Increasing neuroplasticity can be done through both physical and
          mental practice - and even via mental practice for a physical task!
        </p>
        <p>Some common ways to improve neuroplasticity are:</p>
        <ul class="left-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Learning a new language:</strong> HTML, CSS, and Javascript
            count right?!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Exercise:</strong> Going for a walk or doing strength
            exercises boosts brain activity, and has a bunch of other health
            benefits too.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Meditation:</strong> Practicing mindfulness and meditation
            can also increase the connections between left and right brain.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Video Games:</strong> These practice problem solving,
            resilience, decision-making among other things.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Recently my flatmate pulled out a video game (released 20 years ago)
          on an old PS2. I used to play the game as a kid and I was amazed at
          how much I remembered about the navigation and placement of locations
          having not played it in many, many, many years. The neural pathway
          suddenly came alive and knew what to do
        </p>

          I found the infographic

          was particularly interesting and engaging - this is the only resource
          I found that referenced the same ‘mental practice’ as the original

          supplied. I found most other resources lacked in comparison to this
          first intro video.

          This webage is in the context of education, however references an
          infographic from an addiction recovery website. This provides a broad
          perspective in how our brains and neuroplasticity work overall.

    <h2 class="heading2">Growth Mindset</h2>
    <div class="container2">
      <div class="center">
        <h3 class="heading3">
          What is a Growth Mindset and why is it important?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Growth mindset is important as it allows us out of the ‘box’ of one's
          potential achievement levels. Grouping people into ‘smart’ ‘average’
          and ‘dumb’ doesn't help ANYONE in those groups - it fosters comparison
          amongst peers, putting pressure on those ahead to perform to the
          standard, and giving others a perceived limit on their abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growth mindset doesn’t separate people by their current achievement
          standard, but allows everyone to put the fate of their learning into
          their own hands, armed with the knowledge that hard work and
          dedication will improve their success, skill, and/or intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The principle of ‘not yet’ is also powerful as it leaves the opening
          for future development, rather than shutting it down with a ‘fail’.
          This gives the opportunity to keep trying, keep developing, and keep
          going
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading3">
          What does Growth Mindset mean for me and my journey?
        </h3>
        <p>
          This concept of growth mindset is both new and foreign for me. I’d
          never heard the term before - but always believed in the concept that
          humans can always learn new things - it just may not be easy!
        </p>
        <p>
          What has changed for me the most in researching this is the belief in
          myself. If everyone else can do it, so can I! I tend to be hard on
          myself, and particularly the ‘not yet’ resonated as something I want
          to focus on.
        </p>
        <p>
          In each challenge, every time I don’t understand or get stuck I will
          remind myself that though I haven't got it yet, I will with enough
          practice. I will also add to my morning mindfulness, a little reminder
          to myself that I am learning, literally growing my brain, and that I
          can do this! There is no ‘not good enough’ just ‘not yet’.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found
          <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1CHPnZfFmU&ab_channel=JohnSpencer"
            target="_blank"
            >this video</a
          >
          useful as it covered how the fixed mindset and growth mindset are
          different from each other - giving not just the perspective on what a
          growth mindset is, but what it’s opposite is as well. Combined with
          simple graphics it was a simple video that covered what a growth
          mindset is, as well as what it is not.
