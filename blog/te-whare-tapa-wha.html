          These are my goals and plan for my wellbeing using the Te Whare Tapa
          Whā model. This will no doubt be a work in progress, and I hope to
          strengthen all of these areas for my wellbeing.

          Walk three times a week with my dog - I will modify this to one long
          walk per weekend during bootcamp as I don’t like walking her in the
          dark. This also gives a boost to my Taha Hinengaro as I feel at peace
          when I walk with her, and I connect to nature as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m keen to get into the yoga during bootcamp, and will try some out
          beforehand at home too!

          I try to cook and eat healthy meals to provide my body with adequate
          nutrition - having a balanced diet but not restrictive either. I want
          to enjoy my food, not calorie count it!

          One thing that is really important to me is spending dinner time with
          my family - being my tight-knit home unit with my partner, my cousin
          and a good friend. We aren’t all home every night of the week, but
          most evenings we spend time together cooking, eating and catching up
          on our days.

          This is probably my most vulnerable wall. I lean on my home-family for
          support during the tough times, but have few close relationships
          outside of these people. This journey with Dev Academy is a chance for
          me to really work on myself, starting with resigning a stressful job
          and making a positive change in my life to do something meaningful for
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some things I do to help calm myself or feel accomplished is to create
          something. I have learned this about myself in the recent-ish past,
          where I feel good having made something. It can be baking, painting a
          cabinet, just about anything that uses some creativity. I am seeing
          that coding will also fall into this!

          Get to the beach as much as I can. Unfortunately this is a hard one
          especially in winter - but sitting or walking at the beach and
          watching the sunset, or simply enjoying the sounds of the waves has a
          grounding affect on me. I will enjoy the connection to nature at the
          beach too.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am interested in connecting with my Iwi as well - something I have
          been looking into this year.

          I tend to notice and appreciate nature around me often - I am lucky
          enough to enjoy both the sunrise and sunset from my living
          room/current desk! I will see at least one of these every day, even
          during bootcamp I will catch the sunrise.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have some indoor plants I tend to, and a small vege garden that
          provides me with food so long as I put the love into it.
