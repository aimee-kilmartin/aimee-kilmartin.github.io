          <h2 class="heading2">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
          </h2>
          <p>An ethical decision I’ve made was to not get a second dog.
          </p>
          <p>A few years ago now, me and my family had two dogs - a 13 year old black lab Jett, and a 5 year old lab x rottie, Cass. When Jett passed, Cass was very sad. She became withdrawn, didn’t want to play, and picked up some anxious habits. Jett had been with her for her whole life since she was 12 weeks old, and we knew she missed her best friend.
          </p>
          <p>One ‘solution’ for a sad and lonely pup is to get another puppy to fill that gap. For a grieving household it is a tempting idea - a cute new puppy to focus on and give love to and try to heal our hearts. The notion that a sweet new creature to benefit Cass also sounds good on the surface - get her a new friend to love and make her happy again.
            I also happened to have a young puppy literally follow me into my house off the street - was that a sign or was I just looking for one?
          </p>
          <p>This is where the ethics come in (along with a lot of deep thinking and heartache). Sure, getting a puppy might fill a gap or band-aid that hurt - but will it help or harm in the long run?
            Some values I contemplated whilst deliberating the decision:            
          </p>
          <p><strong>Love - </strong>loving a new puppy (or any dog for that matter) was never a question. There's always enough love to go around!
          </p>
          <p><strong>Dedication - </strong>puppies are a lot of work!! As a household we would give our all to raising a puppy, but did we actually have enough resource to give the dedication needed?
          <ul class="left-list">
            <li>Time & energy for walks and training, no matter what</li>
            <li>Time & energy to walk Cass separately, so that the training for the puppy could be focused on</li>
            <li>Availability for 3-4 meals a day? Nope, we are all at work!</li>
            <li>Toileting in the middle of the night</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Fairness - </strong>is it fair to bring a new creature into the household, and not only repeat the cycle for the future pup, but have less availability for the sweet dog we already have?
          </p>
          <p>In the end, I (collaboratively) decided to not bring another dog into the household. I’ve also re-evaluated this decision several times since then, and each time I reached the same conclusion: it wouldn’t be fair, and with full time jobs (and not at home either) we didn’t have enough to dedicate to the raising of a puppy. And on top of that, Cass actually likes being an only dog! AKA a spoiled attention hogging pain in the butt.
          </p>
          <p>Giving attention and love to a new puppy might have distracted us from the hurt for a while, but will it actually change our lives and Cass’ life for the better? Instead of focussing on the ‘new’ we poured our love into Cass. With love and dedication she came back into the dog she used to be, and then went even further into the character she is now.
          </p>
          <p>Even though it is still tempting to have another addition to the household, I believe that ethically I made the right decision for her and the hypothetical puppy. In putting all of the time and energy into Cass we have a happier and healthier dog than we’ve ever had.

            <h2 class="heading2">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
            </h2>
            <p>The people around me when I was young were challenging. I believe people react and develop from negative experiences (especially as a child) in one of two ways:
              <ul class="left-list">
              <li>Copy or develop the behaviour they are familiar with</li>
              <li>Use others’ behaviour to determine who they don’t want to become</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst the challenging experiences I had when I was young were mild relative to what many others have experienced, they certainly had a big impact on who I am today. 
              Household full of arguments and unpredictability? I seek out peace and routine
              Judgemental and mean brother? I want to show others inclusivity and kindness
              Dismissive parent? I need to be loved, cared for, and heard, and I will show those around me that I will give that to them too
            </p>
            <p>Social topics such as race, gender identity and sexuality were not explored in a healthy way for me growing up as well as into early-mid adulthood. I took a lot of insight and knowledge from online resources, and learned from my peers. Again, I circled back to deciding who I didn't want to be. 
            </p>
            <p>Growing up I also lacked a strong (or really any) sense of culture. In many ways I was the typical Kiwi kid - backyard cricket, barefoot or jandals, fish and chips on the beach. We celebrated the commercialised holidays such as Christmas with presents, a tree, and family gatherings with food, but lacked any real depth in the purpose behind these celebrations other than “it’s Christmas this is what we’re supposed to do”. My mum’s Dutch heritage was not celebrated or taught aside from a few tidbits here and there. My dad actively dismissed my Maori lineage, and I have only this year, at 30 years old, begun to look into my family history.
              I am shy and introverted, pushing myself socially or having confidence to just “be me, loud and proud” is a big challenge. Whilst I have no doubt that this is part of my nature, I can’t help but wonder how different I would have been with a bit more nurture.

                    <li>I will utilise my dependability to stick to commitments to the absolute best of my ability. This will be particularly important with group projects or any collaboration, but also to depend on myself to dedicate this time to my goals and learning. </li>

            <h2 class="heading2">Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
            </h2>
            <p>I can be limited in my confidence and my self-belief. Being a shy person, I will be faced with a challenge every time I express myself to a peer or the group. I will absolutely still put myself out there, it just won’t be an easy thing to do and therefore I will likely speak up less than some of the others. 
            </p>
            <p>This could affect my learning as it is a collaborative environment - by the time I’m comfortable with the group it will nearly be over! It is a personal goal of mine to actively work on this confidence during the course.
            </p>
            <p>When it comes to the workplace and my career, once I am comfortable within my team this won’t be a limitation. If a manager shuts down my idea’s time and time again, it could then become a self confidence issue. I am really looking forward to the core subjects and improving myself throughout this journey.
            </p>
            <p>Another limitation I will likely face in my career is due to my unwillingness to take big risks. During my research for this module one thing I looked at that resonated was the DOPE personality quiz. With a 50% Dove and 45% Owl type, both of these are very risk-adverse, they don’t like change and logic wins in decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>Having come from stable, salaried jobs for many years to quit everything and enrol at Dev Academy, relying solely on my partners income to pay a mortgage and feed us, was an enormous decision and probably the riskiest thing I have ever done in my life. The amount of spreadsheets and pros and cons lists I made! But here I am, and so far so good. 
            </p>
            <p>A long term goal of mine is to be self employed/contracting. This will also require taking a big risk, so part of my learning journey personally will be feeling more comfortable taking risks, make attempts at everything, and be less afraid to fail!
            </p>
            <p>I have a lot to learn in both tech and core, but I’m ready to get stuck in!

              </h2>
              <p>In my last job as a Operations Manager, there were plenty of projects I wanted to get off the ground in order to improve the way the team worked, productivity, profit, you name it. I had ideas, but getting the higher ups on board was a difficult task.
              </p>
              <p>One time I had a few things that had been half worked on, and needed input and action from the bosses. In this story we have the following characters:
              </p>
              <ul class="left-list">
                <li>Directors 1 and 2</li>
                <li>Middle Managers 1 and 2</li>
                <li>Myself (the least experienced in management by far)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The first hurdle is getting everyone collaborating. The directors usually work at home and all are in and out of meetings, any online meetings were unfocussed. I ended up picking and empty day and instructing everyone to come in - we’re gonna sit down for the day for a planning meeting and work through *list*. Awesome, everyone agreed!
              </p>
              <p><strong>Strategy one: instruct.</strong> Literally just telling my bosses what to do. I continued to use this strategy later because it worked pretty well. Give clear and firm instructions regardless of status
              </p>
              <p>The planning session had a few challenges. One director was late, the other left part way through to get a haircut but did come back. The ideas and plans made before Director 1 arrived were completely thrown out by Director 2. New plans were written, but Middle Manager 1 keeps arguing small details because he doesn’t understand the big picture. Director 2 creates complex ideas and Director 1 thinks we are making too much work for him to do. Middle Manager 2 is grumpy with the whole lot of them.
              </p>
              <p>Talking in circles wasn’t getting us anywhere. So I brought out <strong>strategy two: visualise.</strong> Using a whiteboard to draw flowcharts, write down notes and lists, delegating tasks. Get it all in front of everyone, worry about formally writing it down later.
                This worked pretty well, though definitely a big whiteboard is better than a small one, to see everything at once rather than write some, record it, erase it, write the next bit and so on. This also uses <strong>strategy three: break it down.</strong> We worked through each piece separately until everyone could agree on the picture as a whole.
              </p>
              <p>I then also repeated strategy one, instructing everyone on their tasks they needed to do in order to put the plans into action.
              </p>
              <p>Overall, these did work fairly well. Eventually we got to an end result, but I could have implemented strategy two and three right at the beginning before we all got frustrated and tired.
              </p>
              <p>This brings me to the strategies that I would try now:
                Take a breather:  Taking a breather would allow everyone to calm down, regroup their thoughts and clear their heads of some of the ‘heatedness’
                Have some food, preferably as a group. Having lunch together (we tried this in a later planning session) allows us to:            
              <ol class="left-list">
                <li>Not be hangry!!</li>
                <li>It promotes more casual and creative conversation. I’ve found  this can bring out some of the best ideas while our brains are resting and refuelling.</li>
