            <h3 class="heading3">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
              <p>I would like to be able to develop a long term career - at this stage I’m not sure what type of industries or specialties I’d like, or even what is out there. During bootcamp as I am exposed to different things I will be able to start building more of a plan for this.</p>
              <p>I am excited to always be learning and developing myself and my skills. I hope that what I do will benefit people and do good in the world, whether that is for work or something smaller in addition to work.</p>
              <p>I aim to get to a point where I have the flexibility and financial stability to travel and work, and be able to live comfortably. I know that there is plenty of commitment, time, and effort in order to get there though!</p>

            <div>
              <h3 class="heading3">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
                <p>My strengths and limitations from the earlier learning plan are still relevant - my determination and logical thought process will be vital tools for me to utilise during bootcamp. In addition, my focus will be an asset - when I get in the flow and concentrate I can focus for good chunks of time.</p>
                <p>My limitation of the internal monologue definitely still applies, though this may be easier with a group around me. I have also learned that I work really well at night after 8-9pm, but have a big afternoon slump that is difficult to push through. Being in an in-person environment will allow me push through better in my ‘off’ times, but I have gotten quite used to the luxury of adjusting my routine to how I feel that day</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="heading3">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
                <p>Time and sleep. With a commute into campus and needing to wake up earlier to get there on time, I will need to adjust my routine. As a household, our schedules usually involve long days so getting lunches and dinners organised will take a bit of juggling probably. With a bit of teamwork and a couple of weeks settling into a new routine this should be ok though.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="heading3">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
                <p>Leadership is a big one for me - and a vital part of this (and definitely not a strength of mine) is giving and receiving feedback.</p>
                <p>I have leadership experience, and it is a natural gravitation for me - I tend to be a teaching type. However, I know there are big gaps in my skillset that I would love to see improved, so that I can be a better leader in the future.</p>
                <p>Another area I would like to improve on is speaking up, especially in front of a group. I know that I can, and have done it if I absolutely have to. To be able to feel more comfortable in this is my goal here, as well as working on some of the practicalities ie. speaking louder, good pace etc.</p>
                <p>Overall I’d also like to be more sure of myself, comfortable in who I am and where I am heading.</p>
              </div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="heading3">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
                <p>Gentle guidance. I don’t expect or want to have answers handed to me, but some help along the way with figuring out what areas I could improve on, and how to know what I don't know - especially if I think I know!</p>
                <p>Encouragement and support are great too, I’m a gentle person so that’s what I respond best to. I am also really looking forward to the Human Skills sessions.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="heading3">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
                <p>Most importantly I expect myself to give it everything I've got and make the most of it, and have some fun along the way!</p>
                <p>During bootcamp I will probably find it easier to ask for help, having met the staff and other students in my cohort. Probably just checking in with the person next to me or the group I’m working with like - hey, can you have a look at XYZ with me? Then if we are still stuck asking a facilitator for help.</p>
                <p>I will write down everything I would like to ask during the Tech In sessions - this will ideally be questions around best practice, what is another way to do X, am I on the right track with this idea?</p>
                <p>Working with others I usually find easy and straightforward, I will be kind, respectful, helpful. I might need to remind myself to not give advice/help if someone is not asking for it - this is an ingrained habit for me. Respect all around is important. </p>
                <p>Workload wise - I will definitely need to lean on the two household members not at bootcamp for day to day life stuff, so that the two of us at bootcamp can give it our all!

          <h3 class="heading3">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>
              Long term I would like to have a career that is not only
              satisfying but also has opportunity for growth and progression -
              within myself as a person, my skills, and financially. I aim to
              eventually have flexibility and freedom, and to not be bound to
              the office desk from 8-5 every day (plus traffic time!).

              A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
              learning
            </h3>
            <p>
              One thing that will be both a strength as well as a limitation for
              me while I am learning is my determination. I will be determined
              to find a solution to my problem - and I will want to keep working
              at it until I figure it out! Unfortunately the flip-side of that
              is I can be hesitant to ask for help, because I am determined that
              I can solve the problem…
            </p>
            <p>
              A strength I have is my logical thought process. I can usually
              break something down step by step and work through each piece of
              the puzzle. I also have a lot of focus and can stay on task easily
              without getting distracted.
            </p>
            <p>
              A limitation of mine is my internal monologue - the negative voice
              that comes out when I get stressed. This can put me in a bit of a
              spin and override my logical thinking!
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 class="heading3">
              What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to
              see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
            </h3>
            <p>
              There are a lot! I’d like to work on the above internal monologue,
              confidence levels in group settings, and my overall sense of
              identity and self.

              A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
              programme. This should include:
            </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work
                productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
                industry/community representatives
              </li>
              <li>
                What you will do when things are building up and starting to get
                to you?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              When it comes to working with others, I will always be helpful,
              non-judgemental, and basically just be a decent human being!
            </p>
            <p>
              I will manage my workload by firstly setting realistic
              expectations of myself - however long I think a task will take me,
              double it. Get help with ‘life’ tasks if I need more study time.
              Then I have the breathing room to be able to work through the task
              methodically and hopefully not have a panic scramble at the last
              minute…
            </p>
            <p>
              If things do start building up - step back for a few minutes, talk
              it out to a person, the dog, my coffee cup - take a breath and
              then get back to it. I will remember to be kind to myself.

              A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely
              way
            </h3>
            <p>
              If talking it out, breaking it down and researching solutions has
              not resulted in a fix for my problem, I will reach out to the
              discord community for help.
            </p>
            <p>
              I need to work on acknowledging what ‘stuck’ is - I tend to stay
              in the researching phase for too long because I keep coming up
              with new ideas, and find it hard to be stuck if I have ideas.
            </p>

              A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
            </h3>

          <p>
            Honesty, support with learning, non-judgement even/especially when
            I’ve made a really dumb mistake!
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3 class="heading3">
              Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
              committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
              commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these
              in.
            </h3>
            <p>
              I have a casual commitment to work on Wednesday mornings (3hrs)
              and sometimes a couple of extra hours remotely on a Friday. This
              is only for the duration of Foundations and can be changed if
              needed.
