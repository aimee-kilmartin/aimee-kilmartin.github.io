            <p>
              Long term I would like to have a career that is not only
              satisfying but also has opportunity for growth and progression -
              within myself as a person, my skills, and financially. I aim to
              eventually have flexibility and freedom, and to not be bound to
              the office desk from 8-5 every day (plus traffic time!).

              A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
              learning
            </h2>
            <p>
              One thing that will be both a strength as well as a limitation for
              me while I am learning is my determination. I will be determined
              to find a solution to my problem - and I will want to keep working
              at it until I figure it out! Unfortunately the flip-side of that
              is I can be hesitant to ask for help, because I am determined that
              I can solve the problem…
            </p>
            <p>
              A strength I have is my logical thought process. I can usually
              break something down step by step and work through each piece of
              the puzzle. I also have a lot of focus and can stay on task easily
              without getting distracted.
            </p>
            <p>
              A limitation of mine is my internal monologue - the negative voice
              that comes out when I get stressed. This can put me in a bit of a
              spin and override my logical thinking!

            <p>
              There are a lot! I’d like to work on the above internal monologue,
              confidence levels in group settings, and my overall sense of
              identity and self.

              A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
              programme. This should include:
            </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work
                productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
                industry/community representatives
              </li>
              <li>
                What you will do when things are building up and starting to get
                to you?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              When it comes to working with others, I will always be helpful,
              non-judgemental, and basically just be a decent human being!
            </p>
            <p>
              I will manage my workload by firstly setting realistic
              expectations of myself - however long I think a task will take me,
              double it. Get help with ‘life’ tasks if I need more study time.
              Then I have the breathing room to be able to work through the task
              methodically and hopefully not have a panic scramble at the last
              minute…
            </p>
            <p>
              If things do start building up - step back for a few minutes, talk
              it out to a person, the dog, my coffee cup - take a breath and
              then get back to it. I will remember to be kind to myself.

              way
            </h2>
            <p>
              If talking it out, breaking it down and researching solutions has
              not resulted in a fix for my problem, I will reach out to the
              discord community for help.
            </p>
            <p>
              I need to work on acknowledging what ‘stuck’ is - I tend to stay
              in the researching phase for too long because I keep coming up
              with new ideas, and find it hard to be stuck if I have ideas.

              Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are

              in.

            <p>
              I have a casual commitment to work on Wednesday mornings (3hrs)
              and sometimes a couple of extra hours remotely on a Friday. This
              is only for the duration of Foundations and can be changed if
              needed.
