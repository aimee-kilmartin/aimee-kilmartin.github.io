          <p>
            Emotional intelligence is one's sense of emotion in people - this is
            both within yourself as well as within others. It is the ability to
            identify, evaluate, control and express emotions. It also
            encompasses the sense of empathy, impulse control, and how all of
            these elements are presented in a persons actions.
          </p>
          <p>Emotional intelligence is made up of these key areas:</p>
          <ul class="center-list">
            <li>Self-awareness</li>
            <li>Self-regulation</li>
            <li>Motivation</li>
            <li>Empathy</li>
            <li>Social skills</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each one of these elements plays a role in our overall emotional
            intelligence skills.

          What Are the Differences Between Emotional Intelligence and
          Intellectual Intelligence?
        </h3>
        <div class="main-text">
          <p>
            There are many differences between Emotional intelligence
            <span class="abbreviate">(or Emotional Quotient/EQ)</span> and
            Intellectual intelligence
            <span class="abbreviate">(or Intellectual Quotient/IQ).</span>
            Whilst EQ is the understanding and application of human emotions and
            social cues, IQ is the ability to think logically, comprehend
            information and abstract ideas, and take new information and apply
            this elsewhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            These qualities affect people in different ways - whilst in a
            working environment a high EQ has a positive affect on ones
            teamwork, leadership and collaboration with others, a high IQ alone
            is more aligned to independent work, and one's own ability to
            problem-solve and apply knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            High IQ is also more closely linked with logical problem-solving
            such as maths, whereas high EQ will assist in better self-awareness
            and wellbeing
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="heading2">Why Is Emotional Intelligence Important?</h3>
        <div class="main-text">
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence is important because as humans we are social
            beings, and high EQ helps us understand and work with others. This
            is vital for everything from maintaining a healthy family unit or
            household, strong friendships or networks, employment and so on. It
            also helps with your own wellbeing, in self-awareness and regulating
            your own emotions. High EQ often correlates to overall positivity
            and the ability to let go of mistakes made and negative emotions.
